# ESP32 Nabaztag firmware

This project contains the source to a version of the Nabaztag firmware customised to run on an ESP32.
It will require a ESP32 with external SPI RAM to run such as a ESP32 Wrover module.

Running `make` may fail the first time with a duplicate symbol error, but running `make` again should fix that with any luck.
