# ESP32 Nabaztag firmware

This project contains the source to a version of the Nabaztag firmware customised to run on an ESP32.
It will require a ESP32 with external SPI RAM to run such as a ESP32 Wrover module.

The project uses [platform.io](https://platformio.org/) as it is easier to set up than using the official ESP32 SDK directly.
